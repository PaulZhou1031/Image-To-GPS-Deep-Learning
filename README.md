# Image-To-GPS-Deep-Learning

#Img2GPS is a deep-learning regression framework designed to predict geospatial coordinates from photographs.

#Our system leverages ensemble computer vision models (EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet) to map visual cues to GPS locations, specifically focusing on photos captured around the Penn Engineering campus.

#Dataset: ~3,300 geotagged images with GPS metadata (EXIF).

#Best Model: EfficientNet-B3 (RMSE â‰ˆ 17.6m).

#At the end, we use the method of model ensemble to gather the output from three models. Eventually the output has RMSE of 18.23m. 

#This image can clearly see the performance of our model.
